# Does the health check notice when the GAME dies and the wrapper does not?
#
# The check looks for a process whose comm starts with `VeinServer`, the name
# the game runs under on the machine this template comes from. The wrapper is
# the image's `entrypoint.sh`, which shares no text with it, so a substring
# form does not lie here; the anchor is kept so it cannot start to. During
# the first start SteamCMD downloads the game for many minutes with only the
# wrapper running, and a check that passed then would be believed and wrong.
#
# Docker does not restart an unhealthy container by itself, so a check that
# stays green with the game dead is a check nobody else corrects.
#
# No game download involved: two processes with the right names are enough,
# and the check reads /proc, not the game.
